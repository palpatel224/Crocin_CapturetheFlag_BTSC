converted jpg to zip 
unzipped the photo in order to get the dummy folder etc
using ls -a dummy fetched a hidden folder
which contained a file which required an input for the correct flag

then upon decompiling using ghidra showed printff function in which the string was present as hex 
since the question mentioned about text to binary thing, i converted the 36 hex values into their respective ascii values and then further the characters
and then using these 36 characters as the input for the question_for_ctf file 
it revelead that it was the correct submitted data
